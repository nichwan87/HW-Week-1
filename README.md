# Homework Week 1 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
Work completed on homework week 1 included adding semantics, re-ordering css file and condensing/tidying code.
Improvements to code without changing functionality have been completed.
Headings have been added for each section in the HTML and CSS files to allow future users to rapidly edit these.
Duplicated CSS selectors have been condensed and some ID's have been made from classes to signify single, high importance use.
More generic classes have been used to replace some of the specific class titles so that future edits and edition can re-use the existing class selectors.
